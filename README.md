Hello everyone!
Today I present you an addon that took me a long time, and that is not finished yet!

If you're a fan of the Dark Souls series, this one will surely please you!
Indeed, this one will lower the maximum amount of your life to only 3 hearts at the beginning. However, you will have the possibility to increase this number thanks to the campfire.

Here are all the functionalities that this addon adds:
- Adding a menu by left clicking on a campfire.
- Campfire limit per player.
- Possibility to record campfires in order to teleport to them.
- New items added:
- Estus Flask
- Estus Flask +1
- Royal Chalice
- Estus Stick
- Estus Emerald
- Possibility to have Estus Flask when right clicking on a campfire.
- Set Home at every right click on the campfire
- Treats the player when interacting with the campfire.
- Suppressing a campfire with an Estus Stick
- Addition of two custom recipes.
- Upgrade from Estus Flask to Estus Flask +1
- The Royal Chalice allows you to teleport to a player holding the Royal Chalice, be careful who you land on!
- Estus Emerald can be obtained by right-clicking and crouching on a campfire while holding an emerald.
- You cannot move Estus Flask in your inventory to avoid duplication.
- Emeralds are finally important thanks to this addon!
- Possibility to improve the maximum number of hearts with experience levels.
